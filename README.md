# The Odin Project - Dashboard

So using the project brief and resources, I used the mock image given to make a replica utilizing both grid and flex. Firstly, I created the page container to hold the sidebar, header, and main components in the correct page layout. Then, I moved from there to each section of the page, adding and manipulating elements using grid to create a solid setup.

Using SVGs was a main part here, with the addition of many icons to make the web page more professional and approachable. I also found the ability to alter and change the SVG by using fill and stroke to add background colors and borders to it.

The main project component was a bit more challenging but was great to really get some practice with `repeat()`, `auto-fill`, and `minmax()` to correctly style the card components and ensure they become responsive when the browser's width is changed.

Getting real experience with the use of `fr` was important as it really plays a significant part in the proportions of the grid layout and gives the page a more responsive design.

I also took this project as an opportunity to use more CSS pseudo-classes, giving the buttons and navigation some interactive features. `:hover` and `:active` were great for making the buttons move or change color based on the user's request.

## Problems encountered
- Altering SVG's style.
- Creating the correct grid for the main cards.
- Aligning nav and SVG using grid.

## New skills
- The use of `fill` and `stroke`.
- Removing borders using `:last-child`.
- Correctly using `align-items` to center elements.

## languages
- HTML
- CSS
